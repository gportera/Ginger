        Positano and Amalfi, which are popular for their scenic views and Mediterranean atmosphere. Northern Italy
        includes the Italian Lakes, such as Lake Como and Lake Garda, which are surrounded by mountains and popular for

    <h6>Climate</h6>
    <p>Italy has a Mediterranean climate in much of the country, with hot summers and mild winters. Northern areas near
        the Alps can be colder and are known for winter sports. Spring and fall are often considered the best times to
        visit due to comfortable temperatures and lighter crowds.
